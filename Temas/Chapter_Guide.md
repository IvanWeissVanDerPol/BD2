# Comprehensive Database Topics Guide

## Chapter 1: Indexes (Índices)
### Core Concepts
1. **What is an Index?**
   - Definition: Auxiliary structure for efficient data retrieval
   - Purpose: Reduce query time by avoiding full table scans
   - Analogy: Like a book's index vs. reading the whole book

2. **Types of Indexes**
   - Ordered Indexes (B/B+ trees)
     * Best for: Range queries, sorting
     * Example: Finding all employees hired between 2020-2023
   
   - Hash Indexes
     * Best for: Exact match queries
     * Example: Finding employee by ID number
   
   - Bitmap Indexes
     * Best for: Multiple conditions on categorical data
     * Example: Finding all female employees in IT department

3. **Physical Organization**

### Key Formulas
```
Search Time Complexity:

- Read Performance: n × Single Disk
- Write Performance: n × Single Disk

RAID 1:
- Storage Efficiency: 50%
- Read Performance: n × Single Disk
- Write Performance: 1 × Single Disk

RAID 5:
- Storage Efficiency: (n-1)/n
- Read Performance: n × Single Disk
- Write Performance: 1/4 × Single Disk
```

## Chapter 5: B and B+ Trees

### Formulas
```
Node Size: Maximum Keys = Block Size / (Key Size + Pointer Size)
Height: Maximum Height = log⌈m/2⌉((n+1)/2)
Space Utilization: Minimum 50%
```
